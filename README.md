# 2THEME

Inspiration Our team, IPSO, was inspired by the topic of vulnerability detection in digital systems because it was the most interesting to us. In a world where cyber threats are becoming increasingly complex, we decided to create a tool that can quickly and efficiently identify vulnerabilities, which is a crucial step toward ensuring system security.

What it does WebCheck is a vulnerability detection and management platform. It scans URL, identifying security gaps and offering actionable insights. The platform prioritizes vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact, helping users tackle the most critical issues first. It also provides advice on how to resolve the identified vulnerabilities, guiding users through the process of mitigation.

How we built it We developed 2THEME (IPSO) during the 24-hour Hackathon Košice – Gigabit Challenge. Despite the limited timeframe, we successfully built both the backend and frontend of the platform. The backend is designed to scan for vulnerabilities in real time, while the frontend provides an intuitive user interface for easy navigation and management of vulnerabilities. Our tech stack includes modern web technologies for scalability and performance.

Challenges we ran into Time constraints were a major challenge, as we had only 24 hours to develop a fully functional system. Integrating real-time vulnerability scanning with limited resources. Ensuring the backend could handle different system environments while keeping the frontend simple and user-friendly.

Accomplishments that we're proud of Developing a fully functional backend and frontend within 24 hours. Creating an intuitive and responsive user interface. Successfully detecting vulnerabilities and offering actionable recommendations in real-time.

What we learned We learned the value of teamwork and time management in a high-pressure environment. The collaboration between our team members allowed us to quickly address issues and build a working prototype. We also gained insights into vulnerability management tools and how to balance technical complexity with user-friendly design.

What's next for 2THEME (IPSO) We plan to continue refining the platform by adding advanced features such as automated patch management and integration with external security tools. We aim to expand the system's capabilities, making it a powerful asset for organizations in need of proactive vulnerability management.

To launch out program you need to download ZAP(special service for pentesting websites). After that you have to generate your own API key which you will lately paste inside vulnerables.py on marked spot. And last thing launch React server and app.py as usual in the same time and wait for program to give you .json file as output with all succesful exploits.
